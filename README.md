# Task planner
Application that documents this progress.

* Every phase can have an unlimited amount of tasks
* If the startup accomplishes all tasks in the phase, itâ€™s marked as done and
unlocks the next phase
* Tasks cannot be marked as completed unless all tasks in the previous phase
were completed.
